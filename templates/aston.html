    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>It all started with one man's dream</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        Aston Soon had a simple wish – to bring quality Western cuisine to the masses at affordable prices. With an idea, and the support of family and friends, he left his job as a restaurant chef to strike out on his own in 2005.
        ASTONS SPECIALITIES had its humble beginnings in a coffeeshop along East Coast Road. Before long, it gathered a loyal following (and a fair share of media interest) for its tasty fare, reasonable prices and sincere service.
        Listening to customers’ feedback, ASTONS SPECIALITIES shifted a few doors down and into its own shop-front, so that customers could dine in a more spacious and comfortable environment. Considering customers’ needs and
        responding to their suggestions and feedback proved to be an important factor for success. Within a few years, the ASTONS brand established itself as a household name, synonymous with quality and affordability.
        Ask Aston for his recipe to success and the answer is surprisingly down-to-earth: ‘For me, it’s about providing quality and value-for-money food, service that makes you feel like you’re with friends, and an experience that you’ll remember for life.’</p>
